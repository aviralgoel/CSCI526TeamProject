**Game Description:**
"In 'Cosmic Gravitation', embark on an adrenaline-fueled multiplayer journey where two players find themselves in the perilous grip of a relentless black hole. As they teeter on the brink of oblivion, they must strategically press keys to gain momentum and escape the inexorable gravitational force that threatens to consume them. But survival is just the beginning, as players discover a universe filled with mysterious collectibles and power-ups, each with unique properties that can be wielded to gain an advantage or decrease their opponents health. 

Strategize, maneuver, and unleash the power of cosmic artifacts to outmaneuver your opponent. The game's true test lies in your ability to balance evasion and offense, as you can use these powerful tools to eliminate your adversary, but beware, they can do the same to you.

**Goal:** The ultimate goal of the game is to be the last player standing, defying the relentless pull of the black hole and outlasting your opponent. To achieve victory, you must either survive until your opponent succumbs to the gravitational force or strategically decrease your opponent's health using collectibles and power-ups.
